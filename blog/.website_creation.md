## DuckDB

DuckDB does not supports JSON5 unfortunately. The reason is that the underline JSON library that DuckDB uses doesn't support it.

## How I calculate the lines of code count

The statistical count for the total lines of code that I've written is calculated using the following command:

```shell
git ls-files | xargs -I{} bash -c 'echo "$(git blame {} | grep "A" | wc -l) {}"' | awk -F. '{arr[$NF]+=$1} END {for (i in arr) print i, arr[i]}'
```

This script does the following:  
Lists all files tracked by git.
For each file, it counts the lines that are attributed to the specified author.
It then prints the count along with the file name.
Finally, it uses awk to sum up the lines of code for each file type.

# Avoid private methods

Quite often I stumble upon code using private methods as a way to hide complexity. I think this is a bad idea. Private methods are not meant to hide complexity, they are meant to hide implementation details. There is a big difference between the two.

- complexity: the state of being intricate or complicated.
- implementation: the process of putting a decision or plan into effect.

## Hiding complexity

Hiding complexity is a bad idea because it makes it harder to understand the code.
If you have a method that is too complex, you should refactor it into smaller methods.
This way you can give each method a descriptive name and the code becomes easier to understand.
This breakdown can be to methods in the same class
but usually is more useful to extract methods to other classes and as public ones.
This way the methods reuse them in other places and also be tested in isolation.
